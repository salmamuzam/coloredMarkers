# CSS Colored Markers Project

## Overview

This project is part of my learning journey through the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. In this project, I utilized HTML and CSS to create colored markers using various CSS color properties. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with different color representations in CSS, including:

- HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)
- HSLA (Hue, Saturation, Lightness, Alpha)
- RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
- RGBA (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha)
- Hexadecimal color codes
- Linear gradient backgrounds
- Styling borders
- Adjusting opacity

I created three markers of different colors: green, red, and blue. Each marker was styled using various color representation techniques to enhance my understanding of CSS color manipulation.
